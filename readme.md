## OpenTable Scheduler

So you've finally decided you want to check out that super popular restaurant and you go to [https://www.opentable.com/](https://www.opentable.com/) to make a reservation, but you find out that it's fully booked for the next while. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Good thing is though, people are super flaky and flop all the time, so reservations eventually open up (yay!). Use this scheduler to be notified when the next reservation opens up!

## Instructions
### Installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:iminoso/opentable-scheduler.git
$ cd opentable-scheduler
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sendgrid
* Create an account at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/). 
* Go to [app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) and create an api key

### Configuration
The config file `config.yml` is as shown:
```
EMAIL: '<email to send notifications to>'
SENDGRID_APIKEY: '<send grid api key>'
OPENTABLE_ID: '<open table restaurant id>'
DATETIME: '<date to query reservation search around>'
PEOPLE: '<number of people for reservation>'
DATE_SEARCH_START: '<filter search start date>'
DATE_SEARCH_END: '<filter search end date>'
TIME_SEARCH_START: '<filter earliest time available>'
TIME_SEARCH_END: '<filter latest time available>'
```
Replace the `<...>` fields as follows:


`EMAIL`: The email you want notifications to be sent when a reservation opens up.

`SENDGRID_APIKEY`: The api key you created with your sendgrid account.

`OPENTABLE_ID`: A little bit of "hacking" to find this field. Navigate to the restaurant you want to make the reservation at. Before clicking `Find a Table`, open the chrome debugger by `right click > inspect`. Head to the `Network` tab and now click the `Find a Table` button. Click the `search` link request. The `OPENTABLE_ID` is in the path of the request `https://www.opentable.com/restaurant/profile/<OPENTABLE_ID>/search`.

![id](http://g.recordit.co/yJ452sEcnp.gif)

`DATETIME`: Date to search around in the following format `Year-Month-Day Time`, eg `2017-07-21 19:00`.

`PEOPLE`: Number of people for the booking.

`DATE_SEARCH_START`: The earliest possible date you want for the reservation in the format of `Year-Month-Day`, eg `2017-07-21`.

`DATE_SEARCH_END`: The latest possible date you want for the reservation in the format of `Year-Month-Day`, eg `2017-07-23`.

`TIME_SEARCH_START`: The earliest time of the day you want for your reservation in the format of `Time`, eg `18:00`.

`TIME_SEARCH_END`: The latest time of the day you want for your reservation in the format of `Time`, eg `22:00`.
